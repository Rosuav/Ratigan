Professor Ratigan
=================

Instruction and exploration into the Page Visibility API and how it can be
used inside OBS Studio.

Goals:

* Have a series of pages that can reliably mark whether a page is visible or
  not. This is harder than it seems due to the light-in-the-fridge effect.
* Test these pages in multiple browsers on multiple operating systems, and see
  if there are any inconsistencies. (There will be. Undoubtedly.)
* Test the pages inside OBS Studio on multiple OSes and see if there are the
  same inconsistencies, or different ones.
